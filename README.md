# TwT-Projects
Tech with Tim made a video containing 21 python projects from easy to difficult. Here I have done most of them .
As of starting this, I would estimate that I am around his level 9-11 in terms of ability, so anything past that will be learning too. I also wont be following along his solutions, because that defeats the point.

I skipped the first 5, as they were beginner levels, and I skipped level 9, as despite not seeming too difficult, it depended entirely on me knowing how a slot machine works (which i don't), and I decided it would be a waste of time to research slot machines for a project I was confident I could complete.
