# TwT-Projects
Tech with Tim made a video containing 21 python projects from easy to difficult. Here I have done/am doing most of them (I skipped the first 5 as they were too easy, as in beginner level).
As of starting this, I would estimate that I am around his level 9-11 in terms of ability, so anything past that will be learning too. I also wont be following along his solutions, because that defeats the point.
