This is level 21, the advanced python scripting. This is another one that I followed along for, and it was a topic that I had very little previous knowledge about, hence the overwhelming number of explanatory comments.
Quite cool though, changes the name of all of the files containing "game" in the data folder, then copies them into a new directory, while also compiling any .go files.

To use yourself, just use either command prompt or your IDE's terminal, and you need to input three values:

1. The path to the python file (excluding whatever is already done by the terminal).

2. The name of the file you want to search from (the source).

3. The name of the file you want to create/send the files to.

An example command to run (excluding the square brackets) would be: [python get_game_data.py data games]
